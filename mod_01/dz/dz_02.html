    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>

    <p>
        <b>Hypertext Markup Language <span class="line">(HTML)</span></b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.
    </p>

    <div>
        Web browsers receive <span class="line">(HTML)</span> documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
    </div>
   

    <div>
        <span class="line">(HTML)</span> elements are the building blocks of <span class="line">(HTML)</span> pages. With <span class="line">(HTML)</span> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. <span class="line">(HTML)</span> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <span class="line">(HTML)</span> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as &lt;img /&gt; and &lt;input /&gt; directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as &lt;p&gt; surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
    </div>

    <h3>Markup</h3>

    <div>
        <span class="line">(HTML)</span> markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;/h1&gt;, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example &lt;img&gt;. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
    </div>

    <p>
        Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.
    </p>

    <p>The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:</p>

    <pre>
        <span class="r">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</span>
        &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;This is a title&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;p>Hello world!&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
